Welcome to the new Jython website. The main improvements are:
- Redesign to fit the modern web, e.g. mobile responsive
- Move hosting to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). To allow easier maintenance and encourage community contribution
- Delivered over HTTPS.

If you would like to contribute you can find the website source on [GitHub](https://github.com/jython/jython.github.io)

More discussion on the creation of the new site on our bug tracker [issue 2658](http://bugs.jython.org/issue2658)
