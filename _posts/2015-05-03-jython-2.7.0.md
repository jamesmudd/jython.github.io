On behalf of the Jython development team, I'm pleased to announce that the final release of Jython 2.7.0 is available! It's been a long road to get to 2.7, and it's finally here! I'd like to thank Amobee for sponsoring my work on Jython. I'd also like to thank the many contributors to Jython, including - but not limited to - bug reports, patches, pull requests, documentation changes, support emails, and fantastic conversation on Freenode at #jython.

Along with language and runtime compatibility with CPython 2.7.0, Jython 2.7 provides substantial
support of the Python ecosystem. This includes built-in support of `pip`/`setuptools` (you can use with `bin/pip`) and a native launcher for Windows (`bin/jython.exe`), with the implication that you can finally install Jython scripts on Windows.

[Jim Baker presented a talk at PyCon 2015 about Jython 2.7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLm3garVQFo), including demos of new features.

Please see the [NEWS](https://github.com/jythontools/jython/blob/master/NEWS) file for detailed release notes. This release of Jython requires JDK 7 or above.

- Most likely, you want the [traditional installer](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-installer/2.7.0/jython-installer-2.7.0.jar). NOTE: the installer automatically installs `pip` and `setuptools` (unless you uncheck that option), but you must unset `JYTHON_HOME` if you have it set.
- A [pre-built standalone version](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-standalone/2.7.0/jython-standalone-2.7.0.jar).
- - A [source only distribution](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython/2.7.0/jython-2.7.0-sources.jar).
