We thought 2017-07-01 was a perfect time to release version 2.7.1 This is a bugfix release. Bug fixes include improvements in SSL and pip support along with lots of improvements in CPython compatibility.

Please see the [NEWS](https://github.com/jythontools/jython/blob/master/NEWS) file for detailed release notes. This release of Jython requires JDK 7 or above.

This release is being hosted at maven central. There are three main distributions. In order of popularity:

- Most likely, you want the [traditional installer](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-installer/2.7.1/jython-installer-2.7.1.jar). NOTE: the installer automatically installs `pip` and `setuptools` (unless you uncheck that option), but you must unset `JYTHON_HOME` if you have it set.
- A [pre-built standalone version](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-standalone/2.7.1/jython-standalone-2.7.1.jar).
- - A [source only distribution](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython/2.7.0/jython-2.7.0-sources.jar).
